# InveighZero

* The PowerShell version of Inveigh is the original version and is no longer updated.
* The tool author maintains the C# version, which combines the original PoC C# code and a C# port of most of the code from the PowerShell version.
* Before we can use the C# version of the tool, we have to compile the executable.

```powershell-session
.\Inveigh.exe
```

* We can quickly view unique captured hashes by typing `GET NTLMV2UNIQUE`.
*   We can type in `GET NTLMV2USERNAMES` and see which usernames we have collected.
