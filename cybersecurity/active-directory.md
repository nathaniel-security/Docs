# Active Directory

* AD is essentially a large database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level
* A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control.
  * A forest may contain multiple domains,
    * and a domain may include further child or sub-domains
      * &#x20;A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible
        * &#x20;It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as `Domain Controllers`, `Users`, `Computers`, and new OUs can be created as required.
          * OUs may contain objects and sub-OUs, allowing for the assignment of different group policies.

At a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:

```shell-session
INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/
├── ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
│   ├── GPOs
│   └── OU
│       └── EMPLOYEES
│           ├── COMPUTERS
│           │   └── FILE01
│           ├── GROUPS
│           │   └── HQ Staff
│           └── USERS
│               └── barbara.jones
├── CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
└── DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

```

* `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` is the root domain
  * contains the subdomains (either child or tree root domains)&#x20;
    * `ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
    * `CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
    * `DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
* The graphic below shows two forests, `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`
*

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* The two-way arrow represents a bidirectional trust between the two forests, meaning
  * that users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` can access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` and vice versa.
