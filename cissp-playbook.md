# CISSP-Playbook

I wrote a book on CISSP.

Not because we had everything figured out but because we spent years trying to figure it out ourselves.

When we started studying cybersecurity seriously, CISSP felt like a mountain. There was no shortage of material, but there was very little that connected the theory to how security actually works in the real world. We spent long nights studying, comparing notes, challenging each other’s understanding, and trying to make sense of concepts that often felt disconnected from practice.

Somewhere along the way, those notes turned into something bigger.

What started as a learning exercise slowly became _Conquering Global Cybersecurity – CISSP Playbook for Managers_ — a book written from the perspective of practitioners who were still close enough to the journey to remember how difficult the beginning can be.

Today we want to do something meaningful with it.

**For 24 hours starting 12:00 AM PST on March 1 (1:30 PM IST), the book will be&#x20;**_**completely free on Amazon.**_

We are making it free for:

* Students trying to enter cybersecurity
* Professionals preparing for CISSP
* Managers who want to understand security better
* Anyone trying to grow in this field

Cybersecurity is a field where knowledge is often passed from one person to another. This book is our attempt to give something back to the community that helped us grow.
