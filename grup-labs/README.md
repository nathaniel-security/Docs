# Grup Labs

Welcome to **Grup Labs** my personal collection of hands-on labs designed to help you **replicate**, **break**, and truly **understand** how real-world technologies work.

> Why "Grup"?\
> It’s a stylized nod to the Turkish word for _group_, and maybe a subtle _Star Trek_ Easter egg (grups = grown-ups). But more than that, it reflects the idea of collaboration and learning by doing.

This isn’t your average write-up. Each lab here is built like a mini-CTF  focused not just on hacking for flags, but on learning how:

* 🧠 Protocols behave&#x20;
* 🔐 Misconfigurations lead to real vulnerabilities
* 🛠️ Enterprise tools and SaaS services operate under the hood
* 🌐 Tech stacks interact and break in the real world

Whether you’re a red teamer, a defender, or just someone who enjoys pulling things apart to see how they tick, **these labs are made for you**.

All labs are open-source, replicable, and structured to guide you through practical insights, not just walkthroughs.

No fluff. Just raw learning.\
Let’s get building. ⚙️
