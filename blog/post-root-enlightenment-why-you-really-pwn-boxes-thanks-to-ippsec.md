> “Root is just the beginning.”

I recently cracked a box on HTB. It was marked “Easy.”\
Intern-tier, 30-minute solve if you’re in the zone.\
I got root. No fireworks. I almost moved on.

But then that IppSec voice in my head whispered:

> “You got the flag… but do you know **why your earlier payload failed**?\
> Why that privilege escalation route didn’t work?\
> Why your reverse shell kept dying until you tried it a third time?”

That’s where the real learning begins: **post-root**.

### 🔍 What I Learned Digging Into a "Solved" Box

Even after popping root, I decided to rewind the tape.\
Not to gloat—but to **understand**.

#### 1. **The Broken Exploit That Wasn’t**

An initial script I used for privilege escalation was returning garbage. I assumed it was broken.\
After rooting, I looked into the exploit more closely and realized it was a **kernel-specific race condition** that required timing precision I didn't initially give it.\
It wasn’t broken.\
**I was impatient.**

#### 2. **Why `chmod` Didn’t Do What I Expected**

At one point, I had full ownership of a file but couldn’t modify it.\
Sound familiar?\
Post-root, I checked attributes: `lsattr` showed the **immutable bit** was set.\
Yeah, even root was denied.\
The classic `chattr +i` trap.\
If I hadn’t gone back, I’d still be thinking the box was broken.

#### 3. **Iptables was Playing Chess, Not Checkers**

Some of my enumeration tools couldn’t reach external hosts. I assumed the box was air-gapped.\
Post-root? A beautifully configured `iptables` chain silently blocking egress except on a whitelisted IP range.\
The box wasn’t dumb.\
It was **secure by design**.\
And I had completely missed it.

### 🎓 The "Intern Box" that Taught Me More than Some Mediums

We joke about easy boxes.\
We race through them, chase bloods, and flex flags.\
But sometimes, **the deepest learning is hidden in plain sight**.\
This box didn’t test my exploitation skills.\
It tested my **curiosity**, my **assumptions**, and my **discipline to ask “why?” even after I had “won.”**

### 💡 Final Takeaway

The next time you root a box, especially the “easy” ones—\
**don’t walk away.**\
**Walk back.**

Trace the steps you skipped.\
Inspect the failures you dismissed.\
Peel back the layers of why something didn’t work as expected.

Because that’s where you level up.\
**That’s post-root.**

🙏 Shoutout to [IppSec](https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec) for consistently championing this mindset.\
Not just to “get root” but to **get better**.
