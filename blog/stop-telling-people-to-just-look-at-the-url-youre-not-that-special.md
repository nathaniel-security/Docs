# Stop Telling People to “Just Look at the URL”: You're Not That Special

You’ve heard it before—hell, maybe _you’ve_ said it before.

> “You can spot a phishing site by checking the URL.”\
> “It’s got a weird character in it, look closely.”\
> “The domain looks _almost_ the same.”

And you know what? That’s great advice—if you're a cybersecurity engineer with years of experience, an eye for homoglyph attacks, and time to squint at every single character before you log in.

But here’s the reality: **you are not the user.**\
And they are not you.

### **The Great URL Myth**

Telling everyday users to "check the URL" is the security equivalent of telling people to spot counterfeit money by checking the watermark, serial number pattern, and ink density. It’s a nice idea, but it completely misses how people behave in the real world.

Hackers know this. That’s why homoglyph attacks exist.

Take these for example:

* `apple.com` vs `аррӏе.com` – looks the same, but those are Cyrillic characters.
* `microsoft.com` vs `mícrosоft.com` – go ahead, squint harder.
* `paypal.com` vs `paypaI.com` – that’s a capital “i”, not an “l”.

And yes, even if your browser highlights the domain, and even if you blow the font size up to 200%, most people aren’t _really_ looking. They’re conditioned to click links and go.

### **Security People, Calm Down**

Here’s the tough pill to swallow for those of us in security:\
We are not the main characters.

Our job is not to make people _become us_—it’s to design systems that protect people _as they are._

You don’t solve phishing by teaching every user to be a forensic linguist.\
You solve it by giving them tools that _do_ the checking for them—and teaching them how to actually use those tools.

### **The Right Solution: Password Managers (And Not Just “Use It”)**

Password managers aren’t just for storing passwords. They’re phishing protection tools.

When a user visits a fake site—even if it _looks_ pixel-perfect—**the password manager won’t autofill**. Why?\
Because it matches **domain, not design.**

If `gmail.com` isn’t `gmail.com`, it doesn’t fill. That’s it.

#### But there’s a catch:

Most users don’t know:

* How to install a password manager.
* Why browser-native managers are better than nothing but not always ideal.
* That they shouldn’t “copy-paste” passwords from the manager to the site (this bypasses domain checking).
* That using a master password like “123456” defeats the point.

We need to **train users not just to “use a password manager” but to use it right**. That’s our job now.

### **Shift the Narrative**

Let’s stop this elitist gatekeeping that makes security feel like a secret club of URL detectives.

Instead:

* Push password managers as essential security tools, not optional utilities.
* Build onboarding and training that makes sense to normal people.
* Reinforce the idea that _tools protect you from tricks your eyes can’t catch_.

***

### **TL;DR (because let’s be honest, people skim):**

* Homoglyph URLs are designed to fool the human eye.
* Telling users to "check the URL" is a lazy, elitist approach to phishing.
* The real answer is proper training + password managers.
* Password managers stop phishing **by refusing to autofill on fake domains**.
* We in security need to stop acting like we're the main character.

***

If you really want to protect users, stop teaching them to spot pixel-level deception.\
Start giving them **tools that do it for them**.

And maybe—just maybe—start listening to how normal people actually use the internet.
