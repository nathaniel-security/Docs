| **Command**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AUTH PLAIN` | AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.                                     |
| `HELO`       | The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.                           |
| `MAIL FROM`  | The client names the email sender.                                                               |
| `RCPT TO`    | The client names the email recipient.                                                            |
| `DATA`       | The client initiates the transmission of the email.                                              |
| `RSET`       | The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server. |
| `VRFY`       | The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.                                |
| `EXPN`       | The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.                |
| `NOOP`       | The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.         |
| `QUIT`       | The client terminates the session.                                                               |

#### Telnet - HELO/EHLO

```shell-session
telnet 10.129.14.128 25
```

```shell-session
Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 


HELO mail1.inlanefreight.htb

250 mail1.inlanefreight.htb


EHLO mail1

250-mail1.inlanefreight.htb
250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 10240000
250-ETRN
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
250-8BITMIME
250-DSN
250-SMTPUTF8
250 CHUNKING
```

* The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system.
  * However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue `code 252`
  * and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system.
  * A list of all SMTP response codes can be found [here](https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/).

#### Telnet - VRFY

```shell-session
 telnet 10.129.14.128 25
```

```shell-session
Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 

VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root


VRFY cry0l1t3

252 2.0.0 cry0l1t3


VRFY testuser

252 2.0.0 testuser


VRFY aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

252 2.0.0 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

* Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send would then look something like this: `CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0`

### Send an Emails

* All the commands we enter in the command line to send an email we know from every email client program like Thunderbird, Gmail, Outlook, and many others.
  * We specify the `subject`, to whom the email should go, CC, BCC, and the information we want to share with others. Of course, the same works from the command line.

```shell-session
telnet 10.129.14.128 25
```

```shell-session
Trying 10.129.14.128...

#### Key Points About Email Headers

* **Information Carrier:** Contains valuable details about an email.
* **Included Information:**
  * Sender (mandatory)
  * Recipient (mandatory)
  * Sending time (mandatory)
  * Arrival time (optional)
  * Email route (optional)
  * Content and format (optional)
* Email Header Structure
  * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322

### Dangerous Settings

#### Relay Servers and Spam Filtering:

* **Circumventing Spam Filters:** Some senders use trusted relay servers to bypass recipient spam filters.
* **Trusted Relay Servers:** These servers are known and verified by other email servers.
* **Authentication Requirement:** The sender typically needs to authenticate with the relay server.

#### Open Relay Configuration

```shell-session
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```

* With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties.
  * Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.

### Footprinting the Service

```shell-session
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25
```

#### Enumerate users on SMTP

* DID not work need another tool

```
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U footprinting.txt -t 10.129.38.126 -v
